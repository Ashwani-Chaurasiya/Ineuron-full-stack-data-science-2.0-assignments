    "### **Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?**\n",
    "**Ans:** OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. The purpose of Python's OOP is to make programs easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. OOP does this by modeling real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using OOP in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reusability:** Objects can be reused in different programs, which can save time and effort.\n",
    "* **Abstraction:** OOP allows you to hide the implementation details of an object from the user, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "* **Encapsulation:** OOP allows you to control how data is accessed, which can improve security and performance.\n",
    "* **Inheritance:** OOP allows you to create new classes that inherit the properties and methods of existing classes. This can save time and effort, and it can also make programs more modular and extensible.\n",
    "* **Polymorphism:** OOP allows you to create objects that can behave differently depending on their type. This can make programs more flexible and powerful.\n"

    "### **Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?**\n",
    "**Ans:** In Python, during an inheritance search, the search for an attribute starts within the instance itself. If the attribute is not found in the instance, the search continues in the class of the instance. If still not found, the search moves up the class hierarchy, checking parent classes in the order they are defined until the attribute is found or the hierarchy is exhausted. This process is known as the \"Method Resolution Order\" (MRO) and is determined using the C3 linearization algorithm."

    "### **Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance\n",
    "object?**\n",
    "**Ans:** The differences between a class object and an instance object are:\n",
    "1. Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "2. Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for\n",
    "a class this doesnot happens.\n",
    "3. A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.\n",
    "4. As Classes have no allocated memory. they can't be manipulated. but objects can be\n",
    "manipulated."

    "**Ans:** The first argument in a class's method function, conventionally named `self`, refers to the instance of the class itself. It allows access to the instance's attributes and methods, enabling manipulation of its data and behavior within the method."

    "\n",
    "2. **Instantiate the Class**: Create an instance of the class by calling the class name followed by parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization (Optional)**: If the class has an `__init__` method, it will be automatically called during instance creation, allowing you to initialize instance-specific attributes."

    "1. **Class Declaration**: Use the `class` keyword to declare a new class and give it a meaningful name.\n",
