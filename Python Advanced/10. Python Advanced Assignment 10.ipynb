    "**Ans:** The difference between properties and descriptors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Properties**: Properties are a simple way to define computed attributes in a class. They are defined using the `@property` decorator and allow us to use methods as if they were attributes. They provide a clean interface for getting, setting, and deleting values without exposing the underlying methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Descriptors**: Descriptors are a more powerful mechanism for controlling attribute access. They involve defining special methods (`__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__`) that allow us to customize how attribute access is handled. Descriptors can be applied to multiple attributes in a class and offer more control over behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, properties are a convenient way to create computed attributes, while descriptors provide finer control over attribute access behavior."

    "  - `getattr`: A built-in function used to retrieve attribute values with optional default values. Used for dynamic attribute access.\n",

    "    - Defined using `@property` decorator.\n",
    "    - Provide a simplified way to define computed attributes.\n",
    "    - Used to get, set, or delete values using methods that act like attributes.\n",
    "    - Suitable for straightforward attribute behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Descriptors**:\n",
    "    - Defined by implementing `__get__`, `__set__`, or `__delete__` methods.\n",
    "    - Offer more control over attribute access behavior.\n",
    "    - Can be applied to multiple attributes in a class.\n",
    "    - Provide a powerful mechanism for fine-tuning attribute handling and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `getattr` and `getattribute` control attribute access behavior, with `getattribute` offering more customization. Properties simplify computed attributes, while descriptors provide advanced control over attribute behavior."
